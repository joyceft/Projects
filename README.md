# Projects
Projects for Data Analysis(Campus Courses,Kaggle, BootCamp, Coursera)
### Zillow House Price Prediction(R/Python):
- Including: EDA; Data Mining; Imputation of Missing Data; Feature Selection; 
- Predictive Models(Linear Regression, Random Foest, XGBoost); Tuning Parameters and Modifying models.
- R Shiny for visualization of transaction and geometric data.

### Instacart Online Grocery Store Customer Reorder Prediction(MySQL, R, Python)
- Built relational-database and ERD, normalized raw data
- Including EDA, Customer Segmentation(demographic, historical purchase behavior analysis, product-based segments) 
- Query, visualization using MySQL, Tableau, for interesting practical requirements

### Implementation of Mixed base-learner Adaboost, modified by Genetic Algorithm(R)
Self-written mixed weak learner of Adaboost with feature selection using Genetic Algorithm on Real-world Binary Classification problems:
- Select 4 base weak learner among 12 model trials and evaluations
- Implemented AdaBoost with updating weights of training dataset and learners in each iteration
- Applied GA in weak learner selection, tuning parameters such as crossover rate, mutation rate, elicit status, etc.
- Reduced final model complexity by 75%, without decreasing model preformance
- Tuning parameters and feature engineering, increased 6% of prediction accuracy

### Uber Rider Behavior Analysis(Python)
- Including data cleaning, extraction,  EDA
- Time series analysis, feature engineering
- Setting Churn label based on different requirements

### Water Usage Capcity Analysis and Prediction(SAS)
Including feature generation/selection, transformation(boxcox, ); feature selection using various techniques/criteria: C_p, stepwise)
in building Linear Regression Model; Checking assumptions, giving diagnostics such as studentized residuals, Cook's D, hat matrix diagonals, toleance, VIF, etc.; Making predictions based on the selected model.
